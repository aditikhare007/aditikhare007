| 1) **LLMs Represent Space and Time** - discovers that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales; the representations are robust to prompt variations and unified across different entity types; demonstrate that LLMs acquire fundamental structured knowledge such as space and time, claiming that language models learn beyond superficial statistics, but literal world models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207), [Tweet](https://x.com/wesg52/status/1709551516577902782?s=20)         |
| 2) **Retrieval meets Long Context LLMs** - compares retrieval augmentation and long-context windows for downstream tasks to investigate if the methods can be combined to get the best of both worlds; an LLM with a 4K context window using simple RAG can achieve comparable performance to a fine-tuned LLM with 16K context; retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes; a retrieval-augmented LLaMA2-70B with a 32K context window outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k on seven long context tasks including question answering and query-based summarization.                                                                                          | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709749178199318545?s=20)       |
| 3) **StreamingLLM** - a framework that enables efficient streaming LLMs with attention sinks, a phenomenon where the KV states of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention; the emergence of the attention sink is due to strong attention scores towards the initial tokens; this approach enables LLMs trained with finite length attention windows to generalize to infinite sequence length without any additional fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453), [Tweet](https://x.com/Guangxuan_Xiao/status/1708943505731801325?s=20) |
