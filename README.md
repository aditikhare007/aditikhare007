## Lean Copilot: LLMs as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean ## 
Lean Copilot allows large language models (LLMs) to be used in Lean for proof automation, e.g., suggesting tactics/premises and searching for proofs. You can use our built-in models from LeanDojo or bring your own models that run either locally (w/ or w/o GPUs) or on the cloud.
